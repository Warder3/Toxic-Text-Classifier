# Toxic-Text-Classifier
This project can classify whether or not a piece of text is toxic. I would like to preface that I do not condone any of these words, and this project is for educational purposes only.

# Introduction
This project's aim was to build a piece of software that could catch if a piece of text is toxic. Then it will flag the company, so they can take action against the offender. This will discourage people from being toxic. This was also a training project where I got familiar with tensorflow, and improved my python skills.
